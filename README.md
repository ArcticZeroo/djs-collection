# djs-collection

Evie (the person who originally extracted this module into its own repo) wants you to use enmap instead. Feel free to do so:

To get enmap, see [The NPMJS Page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enmap).

I had functionality that was not covered by enmap (namely the random/first/etc type stuff) and she refused to support it, so I just cloned her djs-collection repo.

This one doesn't have an obnoxious console.log that cannot be disabled without modifying the module! (seriously though, why wasn't it just emitted to the process or put in the package.json?)

Also, there are typescript definitions as the whole thing has been ported to it.
